Helm chart for Zookeeper deployment

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.  Please refer to
Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs) to get started.

## TL;DR

```console
$ helm repo add radiantone https://radiantlogic-devops.github.io/helm
$ helm install my-zk-release radiantone/zookeeper
```

## Add Helm repo

Once Helm has been set up correctly, add the repo as follows:

```
helm repo add radiantone https://radiantlogic-devops.github.io/helm
```

If you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve
the latest versions of the packages.  You can then run `helm search repo radiantone` to see the charts.

## Remove Helm repo

```
helm repo remove radiantone
```
